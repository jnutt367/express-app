#This is my first express app

This app will be built by going through the express documentation...
I have successfully (through the command line) Initialized, added a readme and made first commit to uthub.
Also npm install express --save has been ran in order to import json pkg thus making this an express application.

This app begins with an Index.html, an app.js that we created and a pkg.json that was given to us by express.js
